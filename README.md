# dwfweb.

[(the code itself)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emelhnn/dwfweb/master/dwfweb)

My attempt at creating a *very bad* 18 line of code
markdown static website generator based on POSIX script, powered by smu.

[smu](https://github.com/Gottox/smu) is simple and minimal markup language
that convert markdown into HTML easily.

* POSIX-compliant
